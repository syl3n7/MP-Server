RACING SERVER 3D MODEL DIRECTORY

This directory stores 3D models for the race track visualization.

Supported formats:
- GLB/GLTF (.glb, .gltf)
- Wavefront OBJ (.obj)
- Autodesk FBX (.fbx)

Model Requirements:
1. Keep file sizes under 20MB for better performance
2. Models should use standard Y-up orientation
3. Use meters as the unit scale (1 unit = 1 meter)
4. Include textures if needed, but optimize for web viewing

For the default race track, we recommend using a file named default-track.glb
This will be used automatically when no other model is specified.

You can upload models using the Model Uploader in the dashboard.
